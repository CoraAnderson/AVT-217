	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The navigation for Mellow Mushroom's website is very easy to figure out. Simply scrolling down the page shows the menu and links to seperate parts of the site like merchandise and gift cards. The menu is easy to scroll through and gives different options at the click of a button. Clicking on the words on top bar of the site brings you to different pages that allow the user to find different restaurant locations, catering options, ordering online, and careers. The words are easy to see, especially because they are different colors. This makes it easy to see where to click to be directed to different sections of the site. Overall, the site is very easy for users to navigate and find whatever they need. </p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>As mentioned in the navigation section, the site is easy to use. The linked words that take the user to different pages are made easy to see and big enough to easily click on. The menu is organized into different sections based on food types, the locations and catering are in different locations on the site, and there are big pictures of the food to let the user know what they are ordering. These three things create a good user experience and great usability.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The site is aranged with the menu first and other elements growing smaller as you scroll down. For a restaraunt, this is important as a menu will likely be one of the first things a user wants to look at when loading into the site. Typography wise, the restaraunt used simple, easy to read type for the headings of sections, still making it slightly unique. For any body text, the type is familiar and easy to read at a glance. overall good hierarchy to show what is important and good typography that makes sure everyone can read it.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The overall style of the website is very in similar to what it feels like inside the actual restaurant. The restaurant is very much a creative space with lots of colors and images. It has almost a hallucination vibe to it and I believe the website is able to capture this feeling. it has very bold color choices and scenery, especially with the swirls in the background. The style, look, and feel all match the in person experience completely and it adds a lot of uniqueness and charm to the website. </p>
